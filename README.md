## About the Project
Every Christmas I have to think hard what to give as a gift to my friends. As the Maker i am i decided to develop a device i could always give as a gift in Birthdays or Christmas when i dont come with any better idea. The device is a simple Clock with a big display and three buttons. The Clock lets the user see the time, temperature and humidity of the room. Additionally, the user can configure the time in case time changes or the person moves to a different timezone.

Besides from all this, i just wanted to try program different sensors with the Atmega328p using C++. I found it very convenient with the OOP so i might keep using it in the future.

Features:
- Visualization of current date, hour, temperature and humidity
- Configuration of date and hour
- USB-C port for UART communication
- Small design for being portable

## Project Status
Project is currently under development. Next Steps are the following:
- [x] Order Board from JLCPCB
- [ ] Order Stencil (i forgot it the first time)
- [ ] Solder SMD Components
- [ ] Test BME280
- [ ] Test RTC
- [ ] Test USB-C UART Communication
- [ ] Write driver for Display
- [ ] Finish writing the firmware

## Getting Started
Coming soon
